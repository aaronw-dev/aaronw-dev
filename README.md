# Hey, I'm Aaron.
I'm a 15-year-old who loves programming, robotics, and game development. I code with C#, Python, and JavaScript. I also write a blog that documents the random things I do. Some of my hobbies include gaming and driving remote control vehicles. You can find out more about me at [some website here i don't have yet]("https://google.com")
